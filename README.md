# Controller - playground for using controllers with Unity

I am using the project to try out working with controllers with Unity; so far all of the projects that I have worked on used touches on mobile devices or mouse input & keyboard input on desktops.  

Now it is time to try out using controllers.

Initially, I am developing on MacOs with a Xbox controller connected over BlueTooth - woot.


The simple game is using an Action map already provided with some sample code from Unity.

The code will take the direction values from a gamepad or the WASD keys and trigger an event callback.

```
public void OnMove(InputAction.CallbackContext context)
{
	// read the value for the "move" action each event call
	moveAmount = context.ReadValue<Vector2>();
	movementText.text = $"({moveAmount.x.ToString("F2")}, {moveAmount.y.ToString("F2")})";
}
```

## Collision detection

- the simple mechanic of the game level is to register a hit of a falling object with the player object.
- this requires the falling objects to be with the 'is trigger' property to true
- also for collisions to register the player and dropping game objects need colliders & rigid body components
