# Controller - playground for using controllers with Unity

I am using the project to try out working with controllers with Unity; so far all of the projects that I have worked on used touches on mobile devices or mouse input & keyboard input on desktops.  

Now it is time to try out using controllers.

Initially, I am developing on MacOs with a Xbox controller connected over BlueTooth - woot.
